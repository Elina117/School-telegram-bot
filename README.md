The bot was made to protect a school project.
Bot functions: making an appointment with the administration, details of the latest events, news, vacancies and much more.
Programming language: Python.
Launched via the terminal and does not use hosting.
At first, I created the bot via BotFather, then I studied the necessary information to write the functionality.
The bot works with buttons and sends responses in one message. To start the bot, you need to write /start
